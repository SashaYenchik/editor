neovim config. opinionated, yet fast.

This comes as a full package, and I don't have any intention to make it modular.
If you want to use something more customizable refer to NvChad (https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad), SpaceVim (https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim)

I want to give recognition to the thw two repositories that I used as a base for this config:
glepnir/nvim (https://github.com/glepnir/nvim) and ayamir/nvimdots (https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots)

This configuration currently builds on top of nvim HEAD
