neovim config. opinionated, yet fast.

Current benchmarks: 31ms startup time (See ./fixtures/benchmark.txt) [Running on M1 Max, 32GB RAM]

This comes as a full package, and I don't have any intention to make it modular.
If you want to use something more customizable refer to NvChad (https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad), SpaceVim (https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim)

I want to give recognition to glepnir/nvim (https://github.com/glepnir/nvim) and ayamir/nvimdots (https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots)
as they were the main inspiration for this config.

This configuration currently builds on top of nvim HEAD

Some env variables that can be set:

- PYTHON3_HOST_PROG - python3 executable
- SQLITE_PATH - path to sqlite shared library
